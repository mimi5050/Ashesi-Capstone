**Overview**

This repository contains the trained models and deployment scripts for the project titled "Investigating the Impact of Accuracy on the Usability of Speech-to-Text Systems for Dyslexic Students in Ghana." The project aims to evaluate the usability of speech-to-text (STT) systems with varying accuracy levels, specifically for dyslexic students.
